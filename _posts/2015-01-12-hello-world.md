Welcome to my blog page, where this is probably the last time I am making any sort of cosmetic changes to my own site. This page will be focused solely on content about the latest works, projects and thoughts going on. I would like to give credit to Ian Brunelli for this [awesome template](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/thinny/). Although it would have been nice to take the time to code my own template, I unfortunately do not have the time and flexibility to build my own. However, I may add a bit more or extend the capability of this blog site whenever I have the opportunity to.
