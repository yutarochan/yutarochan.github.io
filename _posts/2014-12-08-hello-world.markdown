Hello World!

This is just a sample post. Finally, got around working on implementing my own blog in Jekyll, which I had some issues with due to an error with an installation with the Jekyll platform on the terminal. So instead, I forked off a template site from <a href="https://github.com/maciakl/Sample-Jekyll-Site">here</a> and played around with the template until I managed to get my template to work in harmony.

Currently many parts of this site needs a lot more work, so if you do see any problems with the site please wait for about another week or two. I promise the site will get better in time.
