Welcome to my first post where I hope to keep this as a small personal corner of the web to write out my thoughts, ideas, tutorials, and latest developments. I hope to post on topics such as:

<br/>

* Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Tricks, Hacks, and Useful Techniques I Use on a Day-to-Day Basis
* Recent News, Accomplishments, Retrospective Posts and Experiences
* Research and other Professional Developments
* Random Thoughts Experiments and Ideas

<br/>
