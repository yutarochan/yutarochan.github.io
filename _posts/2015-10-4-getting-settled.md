Welcome to my first blog post where I hope to keep this as a personal corner of the web to write out my thoughts, ideas, tutorials and latest developments. Although this is my first time getting to understand how Jekyll works, I hope to post on topics such as:

* Computer Science
* Programming
* AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Vocaloid and Music Production
* Startup Experiences
* etc...
