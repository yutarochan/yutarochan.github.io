Recently, I have reworked my template again to manage the structure and organization of my site. I decided to go with a simpler theme (shout out to ![heiswayi](https://heiswayi.nrird.com/) for the awesome theme!).

For long, I have worked on various projects, learned a lot and decided it was time to start documenting these ideas down and sharing what I have learned though these experiences.
In particular I would like to use this space as a means to showcase my work, break down and implement state-of-the-art research papers, and make it an effort to improve my overall communication skills in how I can
provide technical knowledge and content in a precise, simple and concise manner.

I hope that you will enjoy the new journey and posts as I hope to periodically update this blog with new and interesting content that many will enjoy.

Until then see you in the next post!  ヾ(´∀｀)ﾉ
