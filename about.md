I'm Yuya, a current undergraduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cse.psu.edu/) at the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University.

My interests lie in working with Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Human Computer Interaction Systems and Affective Computing. When I'm not programming, typically I compose songs with Vocaloids.

I am currently as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) advised under [Professor James Z. Wang](http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml) working on affective computing technologies.

Also, this Summer I will be interning at the [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/index.shtml) to work on awesome research dealing with the application of Machine Learning and Big Data on cloud technology optimizations.
