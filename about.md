I graduated with a BS in Data Sciences from the [College of Information, Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a>.

My interests lie in working and doing research on Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Human Computer Interaction Systems, Affective Computing, IR systems, Reinforcement Learning, and more recently Quantum Computing.

I have worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) advised under [Professor James Z. Wang](http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml) working on building systems towards emotion recognition using body language.

I have worked at the [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/index.shtml) as an intern researcher and will soon be working full-time as a Researcher there this Summer.
