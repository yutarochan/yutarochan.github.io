I'm Yuya, a current undergraduate student in the [College of Information, Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> currently majoring in Data Sciences.

My interests lie in working with Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Human Computer Interaction Systems, Affective Computing, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more recently, Computer Security systems. When I'm not programming, typically love to read, reflect and research.

I am currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) advised under [Professor James Z. Wang](http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml) working on affective computing technologies.

I have worked at the [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/index.shtml). I am also currently looking for work, research or internship opportunities -- please let me know if you have any leads or are interested in working with me.
