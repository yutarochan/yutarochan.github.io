I graduated with a B.S. in Data Sciences from the [College of Information, Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a>.

My interests lie in working and doing research on Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Human Computer Interaction Systems, Affective Computing, IR systems, Reinforcement Learning, and more recently Quantum Computing. Recently, I have been awarded as a [IBM Qiskit Advocate](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/9856f2b9-3c1f-41df-aede-35242b3518d7).

Previously, I have worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) advised under [Professor James Z. Wang](http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml) working on building systems towards emotion recognition using body language.

Currently, I work as a Research Software Engineer at [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/index.shtml) working on various projects, both applied and theoretical problems, pertaining to Time Series Forecasting, Deep Learning, Federated Learning, and Stochastic Optimization.
