I'm Yuya, a current undergraduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cse.psu.edu/) at the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a>. Currently transitioning my major to Data Sciences.

My interests lie in working with Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Human Computer Interaction Systems, Affective Computing and more recently Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. When I'm not programming, typically a Vocaloid producer composing songs.

I am currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) advised under [Professor James Z. Wang](http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml) working on affective computing technologies.

I have worked at the [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/index.shtml) on a research project dealing with hybrid cloud security through Deep Learning - and soon to be publishing my first paper. I am also currently looking for work, research or internship opportunities -- let me know if you have any leads or are interested in working with me.
